  # Weather.In
    Designed & Developed By - Avinash Dubey

  
#### A Weather App in React with a beautiful UI and UX. It uses OpenWeatherApp API to fetch and show weather data of more than 100+ major cities of India. I developed this app to showcase my React Skills and learn the working of API calls.
